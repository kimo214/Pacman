# Pacman
The old traditional pacman has come to real life. Two arduino bluetooth connected and controlled cars are used to simulate the first AI game in history to chase each other on a real map using algorithms and hardware system.
The first car (Pacman) is controlled through the android application to walk through the map and collect all the money
The second car (Enemy) is self controlled with one only input needed which is the pacman's Position to operate the shortest path algorithm to catch the pacman.
The project contains the Pacman and the enemy codes (.ino)/Input adapter to process the map/The android application.
